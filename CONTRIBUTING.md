## New features and boards

Feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/ByteWelder/Tactility/issues/new)
to discuss ideas you have regarding the implementation of new boards or features.

Keep in mind that the internal APIs are changing rapidly. They might change considerably in a short timespan.
This means it's likely that you get merge conflicts while developing new features or boards.

## Fixing things

The general take here is that minor changes are not accepted at this stage.
I don't want to spend my time reviewing and discussing these during the current stage of the project.

Only fixes for serious issues are accepted, like:

- Bugs
- Crashes
- Security issues

Some examples of non-serious issues include:

- Code documentation changes
- Renaming code
- Typographical errors
- Fixes for compiler warnings that have a low impact on the actual application logic (e.g. only happens on simulator when calling a logging function)

## Anything that doesn't fall in the above categories?
