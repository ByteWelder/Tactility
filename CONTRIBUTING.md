# Note

During the pre-alpha stage, the APIs are changing rapidly.
I don't want to disappoint people with huge merge conflicts, so new features are not accepted yet.

I welcome fixes and possibly also board implementations:
Please open an [Issue](https://github.com/ByteWelder/Tactility/issues/new) on GitHub to discuss first new boards!

# Code Style

See [this document](CODING_STYLE.md) and [.clang-format](.clang-format).
