/**
 * Every app instance's fd table (see AppInstanceRecord). `slots` is the backing storage for the
 * AppFile each in-use `fds[]` entry points to: `fds[i]` is either NULL or `&slots[i]`. `mutex`
 * guards `fds`/`slots` only; it is never held while calling into an AppFile's ops (dispatch
 * copies the AppFile out under the lock first), since those calls belong to independently
 * synchronized objects (AppStream's own mutex/event group) and may run concurrently with a
 * close()/bind() replacing an unrelated slot.
 *
 * `shutting_down` is set under `mutex` by app_fd_table_teardown() before it destructs `mutex`,
 * and checked (also under `mutex`) by every other entry point. Callers are expected to
 * serialize against teardown externally (see app_stream_subscribe()/app_stream_unsubscribe()),
 * so a check() failure here means that external synchronization broke, not a condition to
 * handle gracefully.
 *
 * `ever_used[i]` is set once `fds[i]` is ever bound/allocated (including the default stdio
 * binding at construct time) and never cleared, even once `fds[i]` goes back to NULL on close.
 * This is what lets app_fd_table_is_app_owned() distinguish "this fd number belongs to us, it's
 * just currently closed" (an app-level EBADF) from "app-module has never touched this fd number"
 * (a real underlying fd, e.g. from fopen()/open(), that a caller should fall through on).
