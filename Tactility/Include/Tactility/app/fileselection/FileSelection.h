 * Show a file selection dialog that allows the user to select an existing file, as a modal

 * (0 = Ok, 1 = Cancelled) is delivered back via APP_EVENT_RESULT once this app's thread exits.
 * On result == 0, read the picked path with app_stream_read(&stream, ...) then
 * app_stream_unsubscribe(&stream); on any other result, just app_stream_unsubscribe(&stream).
 * The caller must call app_manager_stop() on the returned instance id once that event arrives,
 * to fully reap this instance.
 * @param[in,out] stream caller-owned storage bound to the started app's stdout; must stay valid
 * until app_stream_unsubscribe() is called on it (see above).
 * @param[in] buffer caller-owned backing storage for @a stream's ring buffer; must stay valid
 * for the same duration as @a stream.
 * @param[in] bufferCapacity size of @a buffer in bytes.
 * @param[in] eventGroup the caller's own event group, reused for the stream's readiness bits
 * (see app_stream_subscribe()) - the caller isn't required to actually wait on them itself.
 * @return the new app instance id
