Features
   * Enable the new option MBEDTLS_BLOCK_CIPHER_NO_DECRYPT to omit
     the decryption direction of block ciphers (AES, ARIA, Camellia).
     This affects both the low-level modules and the high-level APIs
     (the cipher and PSA interfaces). This option is incompatible with modes
     that use the decryption direction (ECB in PSA, CBC, XTS, KW) and with DES.
