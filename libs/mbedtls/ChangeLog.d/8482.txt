Changes
    * PSA_WANT_ALG_CCM and PSA_WANT_ALG_CCM_STAR_NO_TAG are no more synonyms and
      they are now treated separately. This means that they should be
      individually enabled in order to enable respective support; also the
      corresponding MBEDTLS_PSA_ACCEL symbol should be defined in case
      acceleration is required.
