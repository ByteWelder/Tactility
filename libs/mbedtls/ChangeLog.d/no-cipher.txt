Features
   * Fewer modules depend on MBEDTLS_CIPHER_C, making it possible to save code
     size by disabling it in more circumstances. In particular, the CCM and
     GCM modules no longer depend on MBEDTLS_CIPHER_C. Also,
     MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO can now be enabled without MBEDTLS_CIPHER_C if all
     unauthenticated (non-AEAD) ciphers are disabled, or if they're all
     fully provided by drivers. See docs/driver-only-builds.md for full
     details and current limitations; in particular, NIST_KW and PKCS5/PKCS12
     decryption still unconditionally depend on MBEDTLS_CIPHER_C.
